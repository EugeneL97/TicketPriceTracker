I'm looking to create a script that gathers information on ticket prices for event games and returns the highs and lows for the prices to alert me when the best time is to buy them.

Currently, I'm using this to scout out 4 tickets for the Raiders vs Patriots game so my friend group, who is a mix of Raiders and Patriots fans, to get to enjoy the game live, and at a reasonable price.
